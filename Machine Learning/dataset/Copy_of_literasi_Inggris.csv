In today's economy vocational jobs are becoming more and more important. This is why vocational education programs are popular. Vocational education training provides career and technical education to interested students. These students are prepared as trainees for jobs; jobs that are based upon manual or practical fields or jobs that are related to specific trades, occupations, and vocations.
Instructors teach students the knowledge required for their field. Community colleges have long been offering vocational education. These colleges around the country provide certificates in various vocational fields. They also offer certain degree programs that focus on some popular occupations. The vocational field expands each year to include new fields.
The training for vocational jobs requires less education than four year degree programs. They are also much less expensive. Instructors at this level of education use traditional methods of teaching. They use lesson plans, teacher resources, worksheets, an other tools in this process. One difference to other education programs is the on-the-job training component. Many students will have the opportunity to work in their field while being educated. Some will be accepted into valuable apprenticeship programs. Some of the jobs in vocational fields include construction workers, blacksmiths, and steelworkers. Today, there are other great choices of vocational jobs. These include retail, tourism, and cosmetology. Also, there are some portions of the information technology field taught. This allows students to decide from a variety of career choices.
The retail field is one of those growing career opportunities. Workers can start as trainees and then reach management position. Most retail companies have their own training programs for specific jobs. These make retail even more welcoming to new employees. Tourism is also a great field to consider in the vocational field. This area includes planning trips to being a tour guide.",What is the topic of the passage?,"(A) Jobs based upon manual or practical fields.

The applications, games, and websites that are promoted as 'educational' are not always the best ones for supporting learning. The fact that they are interactive does not necessarily mean that they are much  better than an old-fashioned workbook with its right and wrong answers. Children may enjoy these products for a while but then get a bit bored. Thus, they are not the most appropriate or engaging way to learn. 
Treat so-called 'free' applications with caution. Some will expose your child to advertisements. Others are designed to wait until your child is engaged in a game or storyline and then demand payment before they can go any further. This can lead to frustration as young children do not understand why they cannot continue. Sometimes it is better to make a small payment in advance if the application promises no further purchases. However, some applications are free to download and completely free of advertisements or in-app purchases.
Choosing an app needs the same kind of thought and care you would put into buying anything else for your child. Do not rely only on the star rating. Instead, read the user reviews and check the privacy policy if you are worried about the personal information that the app might be collecting. If you want your child to enjoy learning, develop curiosity, and think about things creatively, provide them with a range of games and apps. Open ended games have become progressively more challenging and encourage children to explore and have fun. They are, therefore, more likely to establish a love of learning and to lay the foundation for their future development.

Head of the Ombudsman Jakarta, Teguh Nugroho, on Thursday said that the central government does not seem to have a comprehensive vision upon handling the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In addition to the recent talks of introducing a ‘new normal’ restriction-loosening concept despite any significant drop in the number of cases.
“The central government is still heavily revolving around political-economy considerations instead of evidence-based policies,” said Nugroho in a text message to Tempo today, May 28. He expressed his pessimism that the COVID-19 pandemic would be able to be suppressed seeing that the central government, which he claimed, remains to be inconsistent despite taking the role of the decision-maker for every Indonesian region to break the chain of COVID-19 transmission.
However, he said that he has seen otherwise. The central government often seems to be adamant tto relax the large-scale social restriction (PSBB) and try to introduce the ‘new normal’ concept amid the spread of the virus. “The relaxation of the PSBB is not unusual. The first and second PSBB phase had been hampered by the central government,” said the Ombudsman Jakarta chair.
According to Nugroho, the central policies that compromised the success of regional PSBB start from allowing people to travel across regional borders for the Eid homecoming, permitting the activities of work sectors that are excluded from PSBB regulations, up to the recent decision to allow people under 45 years old to go out of their homes and come to work.

Rss in Britain began clinical trials of a potential COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday, April 23, as other vaccine developers across Europe also stepped up work on experimental shots against the disease caused by the new coronavirus. A team at Britain’s Oxford University dosed the first volunteers in a trial of their vaccine - called “ChAdOx1 nCoV-19” - while Italy’s ReiThera, Germany’s Leukocare and Belgium’s Univercells said they were working together on another potential shot and aimed to start trials in a few months.
Britain’s GSK and France’s Sanofi last week announced a similar agreement to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with trials starting in the second half of the year. As many as 100 potential COVID-19 candidate vaccines are now under development by biotech and research teams around the world, and at least five of these are in preliminary testing in people in what is known as Phase 1 clinical trials. 
The Oxford scientists said last week that large-scale production capacity was being put in place to make millions of doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 shot, even before trials show whether it is effective. They said on Thursday that the focus of initial tests is “to find out if this vaccine is going to work against COVID-19, if it won’t cause unacceptable side effects and if it induces good immune responses”.
Charlie Weller, head of vaccines at the Wellcome Trust global health charity, said on Wednesday that to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to protect everyone as soon as possible, “the world needs to be prepared to execute the largest and fastest scale-up in vaccine manufacturing history”.",In which paragraph(s) does the writer mention about urge to develop COVID-19 vaccine as safe and as soon as possible...,"(A) 1 and 3

In a basement lab at Stanford University Medical School, Iret-net Hor-irw’s mummy lay tightly wrapped in tattered linen as a handful of scientists looked on. Starting with his feet, the scanner rotated around the mummy, snapping X-ray-type images that appeared on nearby computer screens. The pictures, showing well-preserved bone structure, were then mathematically manipulated to generate 3-D images that give a fuller picture of the skeleton. The highly sophisticated scanning technology allows scientists to learn about the 5-foot-4-inch (163-centimeter-tall) mummy in remarkable detail without doing invasive or damaging procedures. The digital images will show features that relate to paleopathology, diseases that may have been suffered by the individual, also mummification style and patterns - how they may change through time. It will also be useful for teaching anatomy to everyone from small children through medical school.
Iret-net Hor-irw is believed to be an ancient Egyptian priest, and his mummy belongs to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. It was dug up from a cemetery in Akhmim, on the east bank of the Nile. Akhmim, from which the maternal relatives of the famous King Tut come, was an important provincial capital and the site of one of Egypt’s major temples. 
Scientists have not been able to pinpoint Iret-net Hor-irw’s age when he died or his cause of death. The scanning tests may help them get a little closer. For now, they can only date him to around 500 B.C., just before the Persian conquest, when the last native Egyptian dynasty ruled. It is one of the eras which is very poorly understood.
After scientists are finished with him, Iret-net Hor-irw’s mummy will be the centerpiece of an exhibit at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. The mummy has been out on loan from the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco since 1944, and the exhibit, ""Very Postmortem: Mummies and Medicine,"" is considered his homecoming.

In a basement lab at Stanford University Medical School, Iret-net Hor-irw’s mummy lay tightly wrapped in tattered linen as a handful of scientists looked on. Starting with his feet, the scanner rotated around the mummy, snapping X-ray-type images that appeared on nearby computer screens. The pictures, showing well-preserved bone structure, were then mathematically manipulated to generate 3-D images that give a fuller picture of the skeleton. The highly sophisticated scanning technology allows scientists to learn about the 5-foot-4-inch (163-centimeter-tall) mummy in remarkable detail without doing invasive or damaging procedures. The digital images will show features that relate to paleopathology, diseases that may have been suffered by the individual, also mummification style and patterns - how they may change through time. It will also be useful for teaching anatomy to everyone from small children through medical school.
Iret-net Hor-irw is believed to be an ancient Egyptian priest, and his mummy belongs to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. It was dug up from a cemetery in Akhmim, on the east bank of the Nile. Akhmim, from which the maternal relatives of the famous King Tut come, was an important provincial capital and the site of one of Egypt’s major temples. 
Scientists have not been able to pinpoint Iret-net Hor-irw’s age when he died or his cause of death. The scanning tests may help them get a little closer. For now, they can only date him to around 500 B.C., just before the Persian conquest, when the last native Egyptian dynasty ruled. It is one of the eras which is very poorly understood.
After scientists are finished with him, Iret-net Hor-irw’s mummy will be the centerpiece of an exhibit at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. The mummy has been out on loan from the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco since 1944, and the exhibit, ""Very Postmortem: Mummies and Medicine,"" is considered his homecoming.

Cinemagoers will be able to receive a 6,000 won (US$4.90) discount per movie ticket, according to the KOFIC’s announcement made last week. The discount coupons, which will allow theatergoers to watch movies at about half-price -- average movie tickets priced around 10,000 won here -- are applicable only for films screened Thursday through Sunday.
The three biggest multiplexes -- CGV, Megabox and Lotte Cinema -- will distribute the coupons through their respective websites, with two coupons limited to each person per week on a first come, first served basis. Another multiplex operator, Cine Q stated anyone who reserves tickets will get the discount within the period. Four tickets are allowed per person per week.
The discount event was originally slated to kick off as a post-COVID-19 support measure for the film industry around May 21, in line with the government’s easing of social distancing rules in early May.

But beyond the meaningful content of language, a wealth of unique insights into an author’s mind are hidden in the style of a text - in such elements as how often certain words and word categories are used, regardless of context. When people try to present themselves a certain way, they tend to select what they think are appropriate nouns and verbs, but they are unlikely to control their use of articles and pronouns. These small words create the style of a text, which is less subject to conscious manipulation.
Social psychologist James W. Pennebaker of the University of Texas at Austin Pennebaker developed a computer program that analyzes text, called Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC, pronounced “Luke”). The software has been used to examine other speech characteristics as well, tallying up nouns and verbs in hundreds of categories to expose buried patterns. 
Most recently, Pennebaker and his colleagues used LIWC to analyze the candidates’ speeches and interviews during last fall’s presidential election. The software counts how many times a speaker or author uses words in specific categories, such as emotion or perception, and words that indicate complex cognitive processes. It also tallies up so-called function words such as pronouns, articles, numerals and conjunctions. Within each of these major categories are subsets: Are there more mentions of sad or happy emotions? Does the speaker prefer ""I"" and ""me"" to ""us"" and ""we""? LIWC answers these quantitative questions; psychologists must then figure out what the numbers mean. Before LIWC was developed in the mid-1990s, years of
psychological research in which people counted words by hand established robust connections between word usage and psychological states or character traits.
The political candidates, for example, showed clear differences in their speaking styles. John McCain tended to speak directly and personally to his constituency, using a vocabulary that was both emotionally loaded and impulsive.

The thought of a car or truck that can drive itself is at once both exciting and frightening. Autonomous vehicle navigation, as the technology is known, may make life more convenient if it allows people to kick back and enjoy a good book or movie while their cars guide themselves through rush-hour traffic. However, what happens if it starts to rain or if traffic suddenly picks up?
If the technology is to work at all, it will have to be completely safe on all roads, under all speeds, and in all weather. Therein lies the challenge: if cars and trucks are to drive autonomously, they will need futuristic sensors and advanced computing capabilities to respond to ever-changing road conditions.
Perhaps the most extreme example of ever-changing conditions is a war zone, where roads may be reduced to rubble and vehicles are natural targets of attack. Rolling out fleets of self-navigating vehicles for the military is an enticing idea because it could keep thousands of troops out of harm’s way. Nevertheless, will it be possible for these vehicles to operate in war zones? This question was the inspiration for a recent Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) contest aimed at spurring the development of such technologies.
Held at a former air force base in Victorville, Calif. In late 2007, the DARPA Urban Challenge offered a $3.5 million purse to competitors who could design the fastest and safest vehicles that could traverse a 60-mile urban course in moving traffic in less than six hours. The contestant vehicles were unmanned and had to complete a simulated military supply mission, manoeuvring through a mock city environment, avoiding obstacles, merging into moving traffic, navigating traffic circles, and negotiating intersections - all while conforming to California driving rules. Of the 89 international teams that entered the challenge, only six finished in the allotted time.
Wende Zhang of General Motors was part of the team that designed the winning vehicle, which finished with the fastest time - an average speed of approximately 13 miles per hour. The GM team drew upon existing technology already offered in some of their vehicles that can assist in parking or detect lane markers and trigger alarms if the drivers are coming too close to the shoulder of the road. For the DARPA challenge, they developed a more sophisticated package of sensors that included GPS coupled with a camera and a laser-ranging LIDAR system to guide and correct the vehicle’s route through the city. In Baltimore, Zhang will present GM’s patented new methods for detecting lanes and correcting a vehicle’s route, which helped them win the challenge.
Though they won, people should not look for robotic chauffeurs immediately. The technology must prove reliable in many different road, weather and lighting conditions. Still, says Zhang, a commercially- viable autonomous driving product may be available in the next decade.",The best title for this passage is _______.,"(A) Future War Zone Vehicles

The latest round in an ongoing debate over global-warming trends claims that warming has indeed slowed down this century. An obvious slowing in the rise of global temperatures was recorded at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This was referred to as a ""hiatus"" or a ""pause"". This hiatus was first observed several years ago. Climate change skeptics have used this as evidence that global warming has stopped permanently. But in June last year, a study in science claimed that the hiatus was just an artifact which disappears when biases in temperature data are corrected.
Now a prominent group of researchers is countering that claim. They argue in Nature Climate Change that even after correction these biases the slowdown was real. ""There is this mismatch between what the climate models are producing and what the observations are showing,"" says lead author John Fyfe. Fyfe is a climate modeler at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis in Victoria. ""We can't ignore it."" Fyfe uses the term ""slowdown"" rather than ""hiatus"". He also stresses that it does not in any way weaken global-warming theory.
The debate turns in part around statistics on temperature trends. The study that questioned the existence of the slowdown corrected known biases in the surface temperature record maintained by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The finding showed differences in temperature readings from ships and buoys This effectively increased the record about warming. The researchers also extended the record to include 2014. This set a new record high for average temperatures.
Thomas Karl, director of National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, calculated the rate of global warming between 1950 and 1999 as being 0.113°C per decade. This was similar to the 0.116°C a decade calculated for 2000-14. This, Karl said, meant that an assessment done by the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2013 showing that warming had slowed was no longer valid. Therefore, it can be concluded that global warming is a fabricated issue.",Which of the following best restates the sentence “Climate-change skeptics have used this as evidence that global warming has stopped” in paragraph 1?,"(A) Climate-change believers have used global warming as evidence to stop this.
(B) This has been used as a proof by climate change disbelievers to claim that global warming has come to an end.

Young people have put the spotlight on mental health in Mission Australia’s Youth Survey this year, naming it as one of the top three issues facing Australia. The survey found concerns about mental health across the country that have doubled alarmingly since 2011. About 22,000 young people aged 15 to 19 took part in the survey and more than 20 per cent cited mental health as among their top national issues. Alcohol and drugs were cited as their top concern, followed by equity and discrimination.
Mission Australia chief executive Catherine Yeomans said concerns about mental health were at their highest level in the survey’s 15-year history. “If young people are telling us that they think this is one of the top three concerns facing the nation, then we should sit up and pay attention and we should think about whether we’ve got the right responses in place,” she said. “Let’s look at the issues and put in programs that are going to support young people.”
The results did not surprise 19-year-old Savannah van der Veer, who has managed depression and obsessive compulsive disorder for more than a decade. “People don’t take you seriously, they just assume all children are kind of moody and unusual - they do strange things that don’t make sense,” she said. “But I was really suffering and I didn’t really know how to talk about it and I didn’t really know that what was happening to me wasn’t normal.” Miss van der Veer said she turned to her mother and counselors for support.
Youth mental health group Batyr held more than 150 workshops in Australian high schools last year. The program is facilitated by young people who have experienced mental health issues. “What our programs are designed to do is to make it OK to not be OK - to show young people that there are people out there like them who are suffering and going through tough times but that we can talk about it as a group,” chief executive Sam Refshauge said. The sessions incorporate music and activities to shift negative stigma around mental health issues.",What topic does the paragraph preceding the passage most likely discuss?,"(A) Alcohol and drugs
